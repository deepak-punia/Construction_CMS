NOTE: Files are uploaded to the app but then disappear or are deleted after a while because heroku does not support file uploads that means that any changes to the filesystem whilst the dyno is running only last until that dyno is shut down or restarted. Each dyno boots with a clean copy of the filesystem from the most recent deploy.

## Features

- Users can register account and book appointment.

- Responsive layout without any CSS framework.

- Admin can customize Promotions, Reviews, Pictures display style, removed or add new pictures, view users/appointments, delete users/appointments.

- State Management via Redux Toolkit.
